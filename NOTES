The docs are statically generated using the script here:

https://github.com/tdb/libstatgrab/blob/htmlmanpages/docs/genhtml.sh

And then copied in to place in this repository. This sucks, but GitHub
Pages isn't flexible enough to permit building them on the fly. If GitLab
can sort their LetsEncrypt automation then maybe there is a better place
for this site.

The favicon (and organisation logo) were generating using the below site:
